# Sudoku Solver
My solution to the Sudoku game.
 
I started this project in *hopes* that I will understand how **Git** and **GitHub** work and then I decided I might as well learn how to make a **GUI**. Anyway the code is a bit messy and can be optimized and cleaned up somewhat but I can't be bothered since it works and I have already achieved my primary goals of learning **Git**, **GitHub** and basics of **GUI creation**.
 
It basically finds all possible numbers for each empty slot and narrows them down until a single number remains, more messy but overall faster than backtracking.
**GUI** was made in **TKinter**.

**Step-By-Step** option shows some parts of the process, you can ajust the speed it is going by changing the `timer` value.

An example matrix automatically loads on start if you want to test it out but are too lazy to type a whole matrix by yourself.
If you are for whatever reason interested in how it works but you can't figure it out yourself, send me an email.
